# SW8-Report

## File structure
- One folder per chapter placed in the `content`-folder.
- Each chapter should have its own folder with the same name as the chapter.
- One file in each chapter-folder named the same as the folder.
    - Eg. an analysis chapter should have a file placed `/content/analysis/analysis.tex`.
- Each section should have its own file with the same name as the section.
    - Eg. a problem statement section should have a file placed `/content/analysis/problem_statment.tex`.
- Graphic *x* used in chapter *y* should be placed in `/graphic/y/x.graphic`.
- Code snippets should be stored in a subfolder called code_snippets in the same folder as the including file is placed.
	- Eg. if the file including the snippet lies in `/content/security/storage_encryption.tex` the snippet should be placed in `/content/security/code_snippets/encryption.php`.
