\chapter{Scope of Project}
\label{cha:scope_of_project}

We have investigated how we can approach the defined problem. This chapter explains the thought process we have been through when establishing our vision for our solution. This chapter will cover some scenarios that discuss different views for a possible solution as well as some vision representation that have been used in this creative part of the project. This chapter will finally describe the final vision of a solution we deem will answer the problem statement.
