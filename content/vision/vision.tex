\chapter{Scope of Project}
\label{cha:scope_of_project}

In this chapter we investigate how we can approach the problem, defined in \secref{sec:problem_definition}, and we explain the thought process we have been through, when establishing a vision for our solution. This chapter covers some scenarios that discuss different views for a possible solution as well as some vision representations that have been used in this creative part of the project. This chapter ultimately describes our vision for a solution, which we deem will answer the problem statement.
