\section{Snapshot}
\label{sec:snapshot}

% Motivation 
We will also need a model for the gathered data to complement the specifications of how the individual snapshots should be composed. This model should be able handle different types of data from different sensors. Some measurements will be simple floating point numbers others will be more complex types, i.e. aggregates of different types.
