\chapter{User Stories and Acceptance Test}
\label{app:user_stories_and_acceptance_test}

All the user stories, their respective acceptance test, and which iteration they have been worked on, can be seen in \tabref{tab:user_stories_and_acceptance_test}. Because we could not complete some of the user stories in one iteration, we continued working on these user stories in the next iteration. Note that some of the user stories might sound artificial, which might be caused by that we did not have any real customer or participants, and instead chose to role-play these roles.
