\chapter{User Stories and Acceptance Test}
\label{app:user_stories_and_acceptance_test}

All the user stories, their respective acceptance test, and which iteration they have been worked on, can be seen in \ref{tab:user_stories_and_acceptance_test}. Because we could not complete some of the user stories in one iteration, they have been continued to the next iteration.
