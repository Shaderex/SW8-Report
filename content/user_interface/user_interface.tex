\chapter{User Interfaces}
\label{cha:user_interfaces}

In order to enable participants to contribute to campaigns they need a way to interact with the system, and customers need to be able to create the campaigns that the participants should contribute to. Furthermore, customers need a way to retrieve the collected information for their campaigns. All of the interfaces of uMiner and a description of how to interact with them is covered in this chapter. When designing these various screens we have utilized mockups as a creative tool to prototype different layouts prior to implementing them. The mockups for the participants interaction is shown along side the implementation in \secref{sec:participant_interaction}. The mockups for the customer interaction can be, because of their size, found in \appref{app:web_mockup}.
