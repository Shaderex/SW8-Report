% Why do we care?
Computers are increasingly transforming into small ubiquitous mobile devices. With the increase in computing power and variety in sensors on these devices leaves a great untapped potential, regarding the data from these sensors. 
\\\\
% What's the problem?
Reality mining is an area of research that tries to utilize this untapped potential to understand human dynamics and in general try to describe the context around mobile devices. However, the task of gathering information for this type of research can be a rather tedious task, and requires a lot of effort in regards to developing systems that can gather data from these sensors while still have to persuade participants to join in on your research.
\\\\
% How did you go about solving the problem?
We introduce a platform called \textbf{uMiner} which facilitate a more effortless the gathering these kind of data for interested parties. This platform aims at solving all the tedious technical work of such a system, and only leave the persuasion of participants left for customers of the system.
\\\\
% Whats the answer?
In this report we discuss and explain how we have realized this platform and what considerations that have been done in the development of \textbf{uMiner}.
\\\\
% What's the implications of your answer?
By having this platform available we might enable new types of research or systems that uses sensors from ubiquitous to improve knowledge regarding human dynamics or products that is aware of contexts.
