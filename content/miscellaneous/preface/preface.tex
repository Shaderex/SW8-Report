\chapter*{Preface}
This report is developed by project group SW808F16 from the Software Master's programme at Aalborg University as part of the first semester project from February 2016 to May 2016. The overall theme for the projects across this semester is \emph{Mobile Systems}, spanning over topics such as smartphone applications, wearables, intelligent homes and more. The focus of this report is exploration and application of such technologies to a real life problem.
\\\\
This project has been conducted in a \emph{Problem-based learning} setting, which is known as \emph{The AAU model} at Aalborg University, where a semester is split into group-based project work and supporting courses. The members of the project group behind this report followed the same courses this semester. The courses were \emph{Advanced Programming}, \emph{Test and Verification}, and \emph{Mobile Software Technology}. Methods and techniques learned during these courses have been applied throughout the project.
\\\\
