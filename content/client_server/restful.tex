\section{Restful}
Because the server is a single instance and should be able to handle a growing number of clients we must implement a communication protocol that allows to be scaled accordingly. A way to ease scalability and load balancing is to implement a restful web API, meaning that we have a uniform interface from the perspective of all devices regardless of how we choose to expand the capacity of the back end. Sophisticated tools to handle load balancing for web APIs such as Varnish \footnote{https://www.varnish-cache.org/} and HAProxy \footnote{http://www.haproxy.org/} already exist. Which effectively means that we can reduce the problem of scalability to implementing a proper Restful interface.
