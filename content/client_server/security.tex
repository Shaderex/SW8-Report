\todo[inline]{Write section about security of the communication (SSL)}

Since the system should be able to handle personal data, there are certain security constraints that we must comply with as described in \secref{sec:personal_data}. For one the legislation states that the personal data must be encrypted at all times, constraining that all ways these data are communicated must also be encrypted. For this reason we utilize an encrypted network protocol (HTTPS) using SSL encryption.

\todo[inline]{Describe briefly SSL, what is is, how it works (public private keys)}
