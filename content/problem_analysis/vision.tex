\section{Vision}
\label{sec:vision}

We would like to develop a platform that allows for dynamic collection of data for reality mining. Different area of reality mining require different types of labeled training data. For this reason the platform should allow for configurable campaigns of data collection. A customer should be able to to configure what type of data he wants in the set of training data and how the entries should be labeled. The vision for the platform is that people that are in needed of context aware training data can use our platform instead of developing and distributing their own specialized applications to gather these type of data. We imagine that our platform will handle all technical details in regard of gathering the training data, and the only task that is left for the customers of this platform is to motivate participants, which they would have to do in any case.

% Beskriv ud fra vision scenarios at vi er kommet frem til at vi skal bruge private and public campaigns
\subsection{Private and Public Campaigns}
\label{sub:private_and_public_campaigns}

From the created vision scenarios we learned that the project could include profiles of participants which could allow customers to target specific groups of people with similar demographics. We are certain the ability to target demographics would be valuable to customers but we have however found this would significantly impact the implementability of our solution. We acknowledge the need for customers to have a more select group of people collect data and we have therefore, besides allowing participants to opt-in to campaigns which we will refer to as public campaigns, decided to introduce a concept of private campaigns. A private campaign should work similarly to a public campaign except that the campaign will not be listed publicly in the data gathering application. Access to a private campaign should managed by customers through distribution of an identifier for the campaign. We feel confident that such a simple solution could provide some the same value as including profiles of participants while being easier to implement for first viable version of a solution.
