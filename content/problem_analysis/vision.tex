\section{Vision}
\label{sec:vision}
The vision to solve this problem is to develop a platform that allows for dynamic collection of data for reality mining. Different area of reality mining require different types of labeled training data. We would like to provide a platform that can gather training data that allows for human activity recognition. The way this data is collected should be configurable such that it is useful for different purposes, for instance accumulating statistics or to gathering data for training a machine intelligence model. For this reason the platform should allow for configurable campaigns of data collection. A customer should be able to to configure what type of data he wants in the set of training data and how the entries should be labeled. The vision for the platform is that people that are in needed of context aware training data can use our platform instead of developing and distributing their own specialized applications to gather these type of data. The vision for this is to establish a interface for customers where they can specify campaigns, and an interface for participants, in form of a mobile application, that allows for gathering of data for reality mining.

We imagine that our platform will handle all technical details in regard of gathering the training data, and the only task that is left for the customers of this platform is to motivate participants, which they would have to do in any case. Furthermore, this vision requires some collection of data that have potential to violate privacy of the participants of the campaigns, and we will have to consider issues in regards to personal data.

\subsection{Delimitations}
\label{sub:delimitations}
We could, besides sensors from mobile phones and wearables, also consider including external sensors such as cameras or smart home sensors like movement detectors or temperature sensors in the room. It is however demanding to support many different external sensors in an application, installation of compatible external senors where the participants reside could entail high installation and maintenance cost and would require a different level of commitment from participants. There has been attempts to alleviate the burden of including many different external sensors in mobile applications by making it easier to interface with them and write drivers but the problem is still considered difficult and costly \parencite{open_data_kit}. We have chosen, at least initially, to not include external sensing as it is deemed too extensive to support collection of such sensors compared to the one of wearables and mobile devices.
