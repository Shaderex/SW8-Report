\section{Innovation Variants}
\label{sec:innovation_variants}

As described in \secref{sub:essence_innovation_variants} there exist, in the world of essence, four variants of innovations. We do not deem that our solution will be a product innovation nor a project innovation. The two remaining variants of innovation might be a possible way to see the innovation we are trying to pursue.

\subsection{Process Innovation}
\label{sub:process_innovation}

Our solution have the possibility of making it easier to create software solutions that utilizes sensor data. In that way if software companies have access to training data the process of creating sensor dependent applications might change.

\subsection{Paradigm Innovation}
\label{sub:paradigm_innovation}

If our solution will expand to be a major platform where people create context dependent surveys and they never have to ask subjects directly to gather training data. The idea of training data might change since customers will interact less directly with the subjects gathering training data.
