\subsection{Process Innovation}
\label{sub:process_innovation}

Our solution have the possibility of making it easier to create software solutions that utilizes sensor data. In that way if software companies have access to training data the process of creating sensor dependent applications might change.

\subsection{Project Innovation}
\label{sub:project_innovation}

\subsection{Paradigm Innovation}
\label{sub:paradigm_innovation}

If our solution will expand to be a major platform where people create context dependent surveys and they never have to ask subjects directly to gather training data. The idea of training data might change since customers will interact less directly with the subjects gathering training data.
