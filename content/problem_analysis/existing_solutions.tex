Sensor Data is an iPhone application for gathering unlabeled data. The application can use all sensors that are available in iPhone devices in order to gather data, which is then made available through a web API. When gathering data it is possible to store it in two different ways: Capture Mode and Streaming Mode. When using Capture Mode the data is stored directly into the flash memory of the iPhone, while using Streaming Mode will transfer the data to another computer. The data is recorded and stored as comma separated values for easy integration into data analysis software.
