\section{Problem Definition} 
\label{sec:problem_definition}
% Opsumer analyse
% Legal stuff, Encryption stuff, ethics stuff
\todo[inline]{Consider if these paragraphs are too short}
There are, as described in \secref{sub:legislation}, different types of data with different privacy requirements. Some of these requirements apply to this project and the data we intend to collect. We must therefore take measures to accommodate these requirements.    
\\\\
% Health care stuff requires real time - Impacts battery
Available sensor gathering applications and accompanying platforms generally have real time goals, health care systems often have intervention goals which requires data to be synchronized with a central node in near real time. 
\\\\
% Does not allow dynamic use of sensors from other mobile devices than smartphones
The existing solutions we have looked at does not incorporate more devices than smartphones which in general does not have all the health monitoring sensor of for instance a smart watch or a smart band, which opposed to a smartphones are worn close to the body. One could for instance imagine that data from these sensors to be interesting in various health related classification problems. 
\\\\
% Participatory sensing and training data
Gathered sensor data, does not necessarily provide much value without being coupled with a meaningful label, which could for instance be the mental state of a participant through participatory sensing. The sensor data values, by them self, can only be used to train a model which predicts the behavior related to a subset of the sensors without the extra labels from participants. \todo{MÃ¥ske en mere vag formulering eller kilde her?}

\subsection{Term definitions}
Before we define our problem, we establish some terms that will help us to define some concepts in this problem domain. 

\begin{description}
    \item [Customers and Participants] are two types of actors that we see in this problem area. A customer is one who are in need of labeled training data, while a participant is one who will provide the data a customer need. 
\end{description}

\begin{description}
    \item[Campaign] is a term we borrow the terminology from AndWellness \parencite{hicks2010andwellness} which is a concept that describes  the configuration of triggers, sensor data collection, and participant input necessary to label the collected data. An analogue for a campaign could be a survey, where the questions of the questionnaire, or interview, is a campaigns specification defining what sensors the customer wants to get measurements from. 
\end{description}

\begin{description}
    \item[Snapshot] is our concept of one collection of measurements from the sensors specified from a campaign, that discretely and implicitly describes the context. Furthermore a snapshot contains a label which is derived explicitly from the participants. Note that a label is simple some description of the reality in which the participant exist, which could derived by having participants answering a series of questions. In the analogue where a campaign is a survey, snapshots would be answers to this special kind of context aware survey. In other words a snapshot will be an entry in a set of labeled training data.
