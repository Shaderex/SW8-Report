% Campaign definition(s)
\todo{Define a Campaign}
We borrow the terminology from AndWellness \parencite{hicks2010andwellness} and define a campaign to be all the configuration of triggers, sensor data collection, and label questionnaires necessary for a data collection from users    

% Health care stuff requires real time - Impacts battery
Available sensor gathering applications and accompanying platforms generally have real time goals, health care systems often have intervention goals which requires data to be synchronized with a central node in near real time. 

% Does not allow dynamic use of sensors from other mobile devices than smartphones

\subsection{Problem Statement}
\label{sub:problem_statement}

Current health s

The following problem statement and supporting subquestions are based on the prior analysis.
\\\\
\textbf{What characterizes a participatory sensing system which collects machine intelligence training data from distributed ubiquitous devices and how could such a system be realized?}

% Underspørsmål
\begin{itemize}
    \item How can we facilitate ad-hoc sensor data collection of different ubiquitous devices, which might and might not be present at a given time? 
    \item How can we allow customers to define a campaign for their users?
    \item How can minimize batter consumption from data gathering on mobile devices by exploiting that we little real time requirements?
    \item How can we maintain legally required privacy of users and protect their sensitive personal data? 
\end{itemize}
