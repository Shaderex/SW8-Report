\chapter{Problem Analysis}
\label{cha:problem_analysis}

Some initial analysis have been conducted to be able to introduce and concretize the problem area. This analysis include an overview of existing solutions that we have discovered during the project, along with general strategies that can be used when developing software solutions for mobile platforms. 
\\\\
Since the project will be focused around utilizing mobile platforms, along with the sensors associated with devices in this platform, the analysis will also cover the possibility for deriving new information about the reality based on mobile sensors, and different approaches to human activity recognition. The chapter concludes with a description of the personal data legislation and the problem definition for this project.
