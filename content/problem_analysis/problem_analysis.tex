\chapter{Problem Analysis}
\label{cha:problem_analysis}

We have conducted some initial analysis, in order to be able to introduce and concretize the problem area. This analysis includes an overview of existing solutions that we have discovered during the project, along with general strategies that can be used when developing software solutions for mobile platforms. Because the project will be focused around utilizing mobile platforms, along with the sensors associated with devices in this platform, the analysis also covers the possibility for deriving new information about the reality based on mobile sensors, and different approaches to human activity recognition. This chapter concludes with a description of the Danish personal data legislation and the problem definition for this project.
