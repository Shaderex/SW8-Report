\chapter{Problem Analysis}
\label{cha:problem_analysis}

We need to conduct some initial analysis in order to be able introduce and concretize the problem. This chapter includes an overview of existing solutions that we have discovered, and we describe general strategies that can be done when developing for mobile platforms. Hereafter, we describe what the possible contexts that can be derived from sensors, and different approaches to human activity recognition. The chapter ends with a description of the personal data legislation and the problem definition.
