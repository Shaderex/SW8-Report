\section{Ethical Considerations}
\label{sec:ethical_considerations}

With the increasing use of mobile devices in a society where everything is being digitized, the gathering of data also increases. This digitization means that all sorts of data are being collected about the average citizen. This data collection happens in both the public sector and private sectors. The government, as part of the public sector, gathers information regarding health and taxing, while companies such as Facebook and Google gathers personal data regarding the users behavior using their applications. With the increasing amount of data being gathered, coming from personal devices such as smart phones and wearables, considerations about how one store this type of data becomes increasingly important. Professor of IT-ethics at Aalborg University deemed that personal data is one of the largest ethical dilemmas in the recent and upcoming years.

    % Med et voksende antal private og offentlige registre, hvortil flere og flere får adgang, vokser risikoen for tab af følsomme personoplysninger og misbrug af data. Det er det største etiske dilemma, vi går i møde i 2015.

	With a growing amount of private and public registers, where more and more people get access, the risk of loss and misuse of sensitive personal data increases. That is the biggest ethical dilemma we will face in 2015.

Experts deem that abuse of personal data is becoming an increasing risk. One must therefore tread carefully when this type of data is stored, transfered, and in general used. As mentioned in \secref{sec:legislation} there exist legislation in Denmark, which should ensure that these issues are being treated with care. However, because the value of personal data increases for malicious parties as well as non malicious parties, the devastation of it being accessible to the wrong people also increases. It should be in everyones interest to treat these personal data with care, since users have no direct control of how these data are accessed or who have access to it. Bill Schmarzo, chief technology officer for EMC Global Services, an influential cloud computing and storage company, is particular concerned with unauthorized parties accessing personal data.

    But the bigger concerns are related to unsanctioned organizations using my data and inferences about my interests, passions, affiliations and associations for borderline uses about my political, religious, sexual, etc. preferences.

Taking both the legislative requirements and our ethical obligations into consideration, a safe and secure infrastructure needs to be established in systems operating with information that potentially is harmful to the people it was gathered from. We will have to be considerate of the participants by informing them about how we use and process the data they provide, and obtain their consent before they are involved in the testing of our project.
