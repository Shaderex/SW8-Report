\section{Personal Data}
\label{sec:personal_data}

Our motivation (\charef{cha:motivation}) mentions reality mining, and thereby mentions use of personal data. A solution will have to collect various measurements from sensors in ubiquitous devices, alongside some answers from the participants using the solution. The collected data can resolve in a description of the individuals using the system, meaning that incorrect handling of this data could resolve in violating the participants' privacy. For this reason we will have to consider how the system should respect privacy, both in terms of legislation and ethical considerations.
