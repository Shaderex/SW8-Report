\section{Personal Data}
\label{sec:personal_data}

To realize the vision of our system (\secref{sec:vision}), the platform will have to collect various measurements from sensors in ubiquitous devices alongside some feedback from the participants using the platform. The collected data can resolve in a description of the individuals using the system, meaning that incorrect handling of this data could resolve in violating the users' privacy. For this reason we will have to consider how the system should respect privacy, both in terms of legislation and ethical considerations.
