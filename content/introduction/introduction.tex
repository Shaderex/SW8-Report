Mobile computing \todo{reference something about mobile computing?} differs a lot from the traditional understanding of computing. Mobile computing has the advantage that it can be more context aware, meaning that mobile devices are able to react and adapt accordingly to the context that they are used in. In traditional computing, using a desktop application, the context of which the application is used does not change as rapidly as mobile applications. This also means that mobile technologies in general are more sensitive to the environment in which they operate. Given that mobile technologies are highly dependent on factors such as limited computing power, battery life, and connectivity, it is important to take these into account when developing applications.

This project is centered around binding discrete sensor data to some context or classes. This report describes the development of a platform that can produce labeled training data where the classification is done through the help of participants. \todo{Er det ok med de sidste 2 s√¶tninger her i introduktionen?}
\\\\
The goal of the project is to give developers, researchers, etc. a new type of platform where they are able to gather labeled training data from the mobile technologies that a lot of people use. One could imagine that this platform sets the stage for problems to be solved using machine intelligence and statistical analysis. A computer-scientific idea that can be guided by this type of platform is indoor positioning. One could imagine that developers are able to prompt participants for additional information in regards to a building that have not yet been mapped accurately enough. After the prompt they can use the wireless radio signals to create a model that can triangulate their position indoor. \todo{Reference Bent?}
