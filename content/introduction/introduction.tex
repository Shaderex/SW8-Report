\label{cha:introduction}
In recent years mobile technologies have had an major growth in customers. The sales of Smartphones have increased in sales by a factor of 11 since 2007 \parencite{statsia_smartphones}. Other mobile technologies, like wearables, have also seen an increase in demand in the last couple of years. FitBit, a company selling smart wristbands, have seen a exponential increase in sales of their device in the past five years \parencite{statsia_fitbit} \todo{Describe how this increase affects the industry and the development of mobile platforms}.

Mobile computing \todo{reference something about mobile computing?} differs a lot from the traditional understanding of computing. Mobile computing have the advantage that it can be more context aware, meaning that mobile devices are able to react and adapt accordingly to the context that they are used in. In traditional computing, using a desktop application, the context of which the application is used does not change as rapidly as mobile applications. This also means that mobile technologies in general is more fragile to the environment in which it operates. Given that mobile technologies are highly dependent on factors such as limited computing power, battery life, and connectivity, it is important to take these into account when developing applications.
\\\\
The expand in mobile technologies opens new opportunities for studying and understanding the context around the user more accurately. This means that we can obtain better knowledge regarding the users of a system, and understanding people in general. A common way of getting this type of information right now is by the use of surveys, questionnaires, and interview. This type of information retrieval can also be used to understand users in their context. However, this type of information retrieval is rather explicit, as opposed to mobile technologies that can measure the environment indirectly using different build in sensors. The issue with this indirect understanding of the context is that users are more complex compared to the discrete values outputted from sensors\todo{Insert source}. One could imagine that a combination of surveys and sensor data could improve the understanding of people and their context. This project is centered around binding discrete sensor data to some context or classes. This report describes how a platform that can produce labeled training data where the classification is done through the help of users. 
\\\\
The goal of the project is to give developers a new type of platform where other developers will  be able to gather labeled training data from the mobile technologies that a lot of people use. One could imagine that this platform sets the stage for problems to be solve using machine intelligence and statistical analysis. A computer scientific idea that can be guided by this type of platform, is indoor positioning. One could imagine that developers are able to prompt users for additional information in regards to a building that have not yet been mapped accurately enough. After the prompt they can use the wireless radio signals to create a model that can triangulate their position indoor. \todo{Reference Bent?}

Another field where this platform could be relevant is the Telehealth field of knowledge \parencite{telehealth_aau}. This area uses telecommunication to improve the general health of citizens. This platform could potentially enable a better understanding of the human psyche in a more implicit matter, and thereby assist in improving the Telehealth field of knowledge. A vision could be to have an application that could replace medicine used in psychiatric areas. Instead of prescribing antidepressants, a patient will get an application installed on their smart devices that will give them tools to handle their mental state in different contexts. The application could ask questions that counters negative thought patters. Such an application could also be useful for doctors and psychiatrist, since they would have access to continuous monitoring of their patients. The patients would still need consultations, but the doctors do not have to rely solely on the patients memory. In the same way one could imagine applications for people struggling with drugs or alcohol, where an Disulfiram\todo{insert source} treatment could be replaced or decreased by introducing an application that understands the mental state of alcoholics.
