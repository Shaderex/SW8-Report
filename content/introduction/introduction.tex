\label{cha:introduction}
In recent years mobile technologies have had an major growth in customers. The sales of Smartphones alone have, since 2007, increased in sales by a factor 11 \parencite{statsia_smartphones}. Other mobile technologies, like smart wearables, have also seen an increase in demand the last couple of years. FitBit a company selling smart wristbands have seen a exponential increase in sales of their device in the past five years \parencite{statsia_fitbit}. Mobile computing \todo{reference something about mobile computing?} differs a lot from the traditional understanding of computing. Mobile computing have the advantage that it can be more context aware, meaning that the context of the computation can be taking into account when developing software systems for these technologies. In traditional computing, using a desktop application the context of which the application is used does not change as rapidly as mobile applications. This also means that mobile technologies in general is more fragile to the environment in which it operates. A well developed mobile application will not rely on great computing power, battery life, connectivity. Even if it does so, it takes these context related factors into account.

The expand in mobile technologies opens new opportunities for studying and understanding the context around the user more accurately. This means that we can obtain better knowledge regarding the users of a system, and understanding people in general. A common way of getting this type of information right now is by the use of surveys, questionnaires and interview. This type of information retrieval can also be used to understand a user in their context. However, this type of information retrieval is rather explicit, as opposed to mobile technologies that can measure the environment indirectly using different sensors. The issue with these indirect understanding of the context is that users are more complex than discrete values outputted from sensors. One could imagine that a combination of surveys and sensor data could improve understanding of people and their context. This project is centered around binding discrete sensor data to some context or class determined by people. This report describes how a platform that can produce labeled training data where the classification is done by the users and the features are the sensor data.

With this type of platform, new possible solutions will be enabled, since developers will easily be able to gather training data from the mobile technologies that a lot of people use, and with this be able to use machine intelligence or statistical analysis to improve their software solutions. A computer scientific idea that can be guided by this type of platform is the indoor positioning. One could imagine that using this type of platform, developers is able to prompt users in a building that have not yet been mapped accurately enough. After the prompt they can use the wireless radio signals to create a model that can triangulate their position indoor.

Another field where this platform could be relevant is the Telehealth field of knowledge \parencite{telehealth_aau}. This area uses telecommunication to improve the general health of citizens. This platform could potentially enable an understanding of the human psyche in a more implicit and effortless matter for citizens, and thereby assist improving the Telehealth field of knowledge. A vision could be to have an application that could complete replace medicine. Instead of prescribing antidepressants a patient will get an application install on their smart devices that will give them tools to handle their mental state in different contexts. For instance asking them questions that counters negative thought patters. Such an applications could also be useful for doctors and psychiatrist. A depressed patient would still need to go some consultations, but now the experts have access to more continuous monitoring of their patients and is not only able to evaluate their treatment every other week. In the same way one could imagine applications for people struggling with drugs or alcohol, where antabus is replaced or decreased by introducing an application that understands the mental state of alcoholics.
