\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{cha:quality_assurance}

This chapter describes some of the different measures we have used in order ensure the quality of uMiner. This chapter will also cover some reflections in regards to the way we have used, and gained from, different tools and techniques, such as continuous integration, unit tests, manual test, and general product evaluation through fellow software engineering students and  people outside this category.

When executing any dynamic test, i.e. tests that runs code on some device, we tried to run it on as many devices as possible. This was done in order to test our system on different hardware configurations and over different Android versions.
