\chapter{Quality Assurance}
\label{cha:quality_assurance}

This section describes the different measures we have used in order ensure the quality of our developed product 
\\\\
\todo{Write more intro to QA}. 
When we executed tests that required that we run the code om some device, we always attempted to run it on multiple different devices in order to support several different hardware configurations and also that we are compatible with multiple Android versions. The phones we have available all run stock Android versions from the Android open source project. This might indicate that we also cover additional OS versions that are based on the stock versions, since if we find some bug when we test against the stock version, it is most likely also present in the modified version.
