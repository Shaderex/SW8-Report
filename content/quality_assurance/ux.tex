\section{Participant Experience Evaluation}
\label{sec:participant_experience_evaluation}

We want uMiner to be as general as possible in terms of who participants might be. We have for this reason tried to create some sort of user experience evaluation in regards to the part of the system the participants are going to use. The idea of this evaluation is, to determine whether there are some obvious flaws in the design of our Android application, especially in regards to how disturbing the application is for participants. 
\\\\
The evaluation was performed with five people, who all had a compatible smartphone. This is not an adequate amount of test subjects to provide any statistical evidence for the evaluation of the system, but we hoped to get some constructive evaluation of the application. Note that the personas for these five test subjects are rather similar: They are all males in their start 20s, who share similar interests, and are tech savvy to some extent.

\subsection{Setup}
\label{sub:setup}

We have created a test campaign called ``Alcohol and you'', which should emulate the type of campaign a final customer might specify. The campaign specification can be seen in \tabref{tab:test_campaign_spec}. This specification means that 600 measurements should be performed every hour, and that a questionnaire is prompted every two hours. The test campaign would run for a 24 hours.

The application was distributed and installed on the test subjects' devices, and the test subjects were guided on how they could start contributing to our test campaign. Thereby the test does not in any way evaluate the user experience of browsing and joining campaigns, but only evaluates the experience of being notified with questions by the application. After the setup of the application, we told the test subjects to proceed with their daily lives, and treat the uMiner application as any other application they might have installed from the Google Play Store. 

\subsection{Results}
\label{sub:results}
After 24 hours of the application being installed on the test participants' devices, we asked them a series of questions to understand the disturbance that the notifications and questionnaires had caused them throughout the day. The results of this survey can be seen in \tabref{fig:survey_results}. These results show that our participants, in general, were not disturbed to a severe degree. Most of the participants did answer that they were not disturbed at all, as seen in \figref{fig:general_disturbance}. The one person who felt disturbed only deemed it to be a degree 2 out of 5 of disturbance, as seen in \figref{fig:disturbance_level}. In \figref{fig:ingore_notifications} it can be seen that only 1 in 5 ignored some amount of notifications, and they only did so for half of the notifications or less. Lastly none of the test participants felt like uninstalling the application after contributing for a day, as seen in \figref{fig:want_to_uninstall}.

The general user experience regarding the notifications and questionnaires seems promising, based on our small group of test participants. We additionally received some qualitative feedback for the application, in contrast to the quantitative feedback from \figref{fig:survey_results}. The same test subject who felt a bit disturbed by our application replied with the following comment on the fact, that we ask the same question multiple times throughout a day:

\begin{quote}
    \translated{If I was not drunk at 6.20 in the morning, I am probably not drunk at 8 or 10 either.}
\end{quote}

We hear the concern of this participant, and we can see why it can be rather tedious to answer the questionnaires, when the user is prompted for the exact same thing over and over. One could imagine, that the platform could provide a better way of prompting for questions, for instance once a day, instead of some time relative to when the campaign was initiated. With the ``Alcohol and you'' campaign, one could imagine that the user was asked daily with something like, ``Have you consumed alcohol today?'', and then give the user some timespan for which the question counts, i.e. the periods in which snapshots were measured. However, with this approach the accuracy of the provided labels rely on the memory of the participants, and this might pollute the snapshots with less accurate labels. We conclude, from this feedback, that it is important that the system provides great tools for the customer, to specify how and when he wants to ask the participants questions, as we previously described in \secref{sub:answering_questionnaired} and as suggested by the opponent group in \secref{sub:second_meeting_product_evaluation}. 
\\\\
In the end, the customer wants to get as accurate data as possible, while still disturbing the participants as little as possible. It will be a challenge to maintain both of these qualities or find a good trade-off between them.
