\section{The Campaign Model}
Conceptually, a \emph{snapshots} is a snippet of the reality (context) that a specific participants exists in, measured through the subjects devices along with a \emph{label}, describing this reality further. This label is used to define the reality in ways that available sensors cannot. By examining snapshots, and their labels, customers will be able to recognize patterns in measurements, and be able to see a correlation between sensor output and human dynamics. To see development of patterns in time, multiple measurements might be required. To facilitate this, a snapshot consists of a series of \emph{measurements}, each divided into \emph{samples}. To avoid collection redundant data, and wasting the participants resources, the customer must specify what sensors are required, the temporal properties of snapshots, and also how the data should be labeled. This is done through specifying a \emph{campaign}, which participants can contribute to.

One could imagine that a customer might be interested in finding a correlation between heart rate and movement patterns and the influence of alcohol. To do this, a customer would specify a campaign, which should collect information regarding sensors such as \emph{heart rate}, \emph{accelerometer}, and \emph{GPS location}. To know if the participants have consumed alcohol, the customer would specify that participants should indicate if they are, or have been, under the influence of alcohol at a specific time. When contributing information to this campaign, participants would submit snapshots matching this specification. An illustration of how these snapshots are structured can be seen in \figref{fig:snapshot_example}. In this example, the participants are asked to label the snapshot by answering the question \emph{Are you under the influence by alcohol?}.
