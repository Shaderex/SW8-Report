\section{Structuring Sensor Data}
\label{sec:modeling_sensor_data}

As stated in our vision in \secref{sec:vision}, the data collected by uMiner should be usable in various application areas, such as machine intelligence or statistics. In many of these application areas, it is beneficial if the data is structured in an uniform way. This section describes how we have tried to structure the data, and furthermore tries to concretize some of the concepts introduced in the term definition in \secref{sec:problem_definition} in relation to the developed system. 
\\\\
Conceptually, a \emph{snapshot} is a snippet of the reality (context) that a specific participant exists in, measured through the participants' devices, along with a \emph{label}, describing the context further. This label is used to define the context in ways that available sensors cannot. By examining the measured context and the labels describing these measurements, customers will be able to search for patterns in the data, and thereby they might be able to see a correlation between sensor output and human dynamics. To search for temporal patterns in the data collected from the continuous- and reactive sensors, covered in \secref{sec:deriving_the_context_from_sensors}, multiple measurements are required. An example of this could be measuring the location of a participant over time to see that a user is moving. In order to see this development over time, time has to pass between every measurement. This timespan depends on what the customer desires to measure, and therefore he must be able to configure how long a delay there should be between every sensor reading. To define this timespan, and other aspects such as which sensors to measure from, and when to present the questionnaire to the participants, the customer must define a \emph{campaign}.
\\\\
One could imagine that a customer might be interested in finding a correlation between heart rate, movement patterns, and the influence of alcohol. In order to do this, a customer could create a campaign, in which he specifies which information should be gathered from the sensors, such as heart rate, acceleration, and GPS location. The customer would furthermore specify questions for the participants, asking whether they are, or have been, under the influence of alcohol at a specific time. One could alternatively utilize a breathalyzer, but these are not common in mobile devices, making a questionnaire a viable alternate method for distinguishing if the participant has consumed alcohol. The created specification can then be used as a recipe for creating and submitting snapshots, possibly including labels provided by participants. An illustration of how a snapshot is structured can be seen in \figref{fig:snapshot_model_no_samples}, which shows how time elapses between every measurement. In this example, the participants are asked to answer the question: \emph{Are you under the influence of alcohol?} in order to label the data.

\subsection{Temporal Properties of Snapshots}
\label{sec:temporal_properties_of_snapshots}

As previously mentioned, we would need more than a single reading from a sensor in order to search for temporal patterns in the data, which is why we introduce the \emph{measurement} concept shown in \figref{fig:snapshot_model_no_samples}. However, using a raw data stream from the sensors resulted in large quantities of data as covered in the previous section. This data would have to be sent over the Internet to provide it to the customers. This is, as mentioned in \secref{sec:general_strategies}, a task that might consume a lot of power, and therby be an inconvenience for the participants. 
\\\\
This presents a conflict between the customers and the participants of the system. The customers would probably like to receive as much data as possible, whereas the participants would like the collection to affect their phone as little as possible. One could argue that the customers would be interested in lowering the power consumption and bandwidth usage on the participants devices because they would like to avoid discouraging them from contributing to their campaign. 
\\\\
In order to mitigate this conflict, we have introduced a span between a sequence of \emph{measurements}, that the customer can regulate in order to reduce the battery and network consumption on the participants' devices. To be able to talk about this sequence of measurements we introduce another concept that we call \emph{sample}. A \emph{sample} is simply such a sequence of \emph{measurements} with an interval between them, as seen in \figref{fig:snapshot_example_with_samples}. This allows customers to make sense of continuous sensor readings, but in a periodic manner, that avoids unnecessary strain on the participants' devices.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\end{figure}

We want customers to configure how often \emph{measurement}s should be made, and we therefore allow them to define a \emph{measurement frequency} for their \emph{campaign}. Customers should furthermore be able to define how often \emph{sample}s should be gathered, and for that reason we allow them to define a \emph{sample frequency}. The length of the \emph{snapshot} is configurable by defining how many \emph{sample}s the customer wants for a single \emph{snapshot}. This is used to calculate what we call \emph{total duration}, which states for how long samples should be generated for a snapshot. All of this is illustrated in \figref{fig:sample_temporality}. In order for a customer to get his snapshots labeled, he needs to create questions that will be asked to the participants. The answers from the questionnaire are then used as a label for that particular snapshot. This means that a label can either be a single answer, if the questionnaire only contains a single question, or, a sequence of answers, if the questionnaire contains a sequence of questions. An example of a label, containing only a single answer, for a snapshot can be seen in \figref{fig:snapshot_example_with_samples}.

By this temporal structure of the sensor data we provide a viable way of configuring how the snapshots should be structured in regards to sensor readings, while maintaining a uniform output format for customers of the system.
