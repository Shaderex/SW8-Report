\section{Background Sensor Service}
\label{sec:background_sensor_service}

We have implemented a service, which we call Background Sensor Service, in order to facility non-intrusive data collection in the Android system. 
This section includes some technical details about these  . 

\subsection{What is a service?}

A services in Android is an application component which encapsulates long running background processing or a way to provide access to a shared ressource. Services can be shared and can be configured run independently from the graphical interface shown to users, which is ideal for our background data collection.

\subsection{Service Start}

The service should ideally always be running, which does not imply that it is constantly using processing ressources. We have implemented two measures to ensures that the service is running

% Boot receiver
% On Application start
