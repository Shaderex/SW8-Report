\chapter{Gathering Sensor Data}
\label{cha:gathering_sensor_data}

\todo[inline]{Rikke: This chapter need some rework: ``Der er meget indforst√•et information i dette kapitel''}
A cores feature of the platform we are developing is the functionality to gather sensor data from the devices of the participants of the campaigns. This chapter describes how we structured the data that the sensors are able to provide, and how we implemented the functionality that can provide us with these data. As described in \secref{sec:deriving_the_context_from_sensors}, there exist various types of sensors, each sensing various types of data in various formats. We want to investigate how we can provide the customers with the sensor data they require in a viable way.
