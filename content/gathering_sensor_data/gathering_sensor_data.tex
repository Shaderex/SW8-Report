\chapter{Gathering Sensor Data}
\label{cha:gathering_sensor_data}

A core feature of the platform, we are developing, is the ability to gather sensor data from the participants' devices. This chapter describes how this sensor data is structured, but also the functionality that ensures that we handle this gathering concurrently such that the collection of data from different sensors do not interfere.
