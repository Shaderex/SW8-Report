\chapter{Gathering Sensor Data}
\label{cha:gathering_sensor_data}

A core feature of the uMiner is the ability to gather sensor data from the participants' devices. This chapter describes how this data is structured, but also how we handle the gathering of sensor data concurrently. Furthermore, the chapter will cover some of the measures we have taken to minimize the network impact of the Android application.
