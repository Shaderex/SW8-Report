\label{cha:security}

Because the system should handle personal data, there are certain security requirements that we must comply with as described in \secref{sec:personal_data}. The legislation states that the personal data must be encrypted at all times, which then requires that any form communication, which includes this data, must also be encrypted. For this reason we utilize an encrypted network protocol (HTTPS) using SSL encryption.
