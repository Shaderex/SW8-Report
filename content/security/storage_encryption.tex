\section{Storage Encryption}
\label{sec:storage_encryption}
% Skriv om at vi skal gemme data sikkert
According to the legislation briefly described in \secref{sub:legislation}, data that can identify individuals must be encrypted. In our case we both need to store data locally on the clients Android device, as well as remotely on a server dedicated to storing the data and showing it to the correct customers, meaning that we will have to consider the security and encryption in two different code bases and on two different platforms. 

\subsection{Local Storage}
\label{sub:local_storage}
We decided to look at different options to ensure, that we could safely store the gathered data on Android devices. Storing the data locally requires a local solution for encrypting all data saved in persistent storage on the device. 
\\\\
Firstly, we considered the SQLite database that is natively supported by Android. The problem with using SQLite is the fact that we would have to create a schema for each of the sensors and their data types, making it a longsome task, and the process of adding new sensors would also become more tedious making the system less adaptable to new sensors. Furthermore to ensure encryption on a SQLite database we would have to use an extension to SQLite called SQLCipher\footnote{https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/} which would allow us to encrypt the database. 
\\\\
Another option that we looked at was android-simple-storage (ASS)\footnote{https://github.com/sromku/android-simple-storage}, which, as the name implies, is a simple library for handling the internal (storage reserved for an application and only accessible through the application it is reserved for) and external (SD card or other shared storage) storage in Android. ASS allowed us a simple interface to this file system while at the same time it made it possible to encrypt the data directly through the library by specifying a few options. We therefore tried to implement a prototype of this as our main storage for the application.

Lastly, we came across Realm\footnote{https://realm.io/}, which the developers behind it says should be the replacement for SQLite, and that it should not just be an ORM on top of it. Realm uses its own persistence engine, and is cross-platform (IOS/Android) meaning that the same Realm file can be shared across multiple platforms. Realm natively supports encryption of the data. We ended up choosing Realm for our persistence layer. One of the drawbacks of Realm is that it only supports a single level of inheritance to specify which objects should be able to be stored persistently. All persistent objects must directly be children of a class called \mono{RealmObject} and it is therefore not possibly to create complex inheritance hierarchies with multiple levels of inheritance with abstract classes to help minimize code duplication.  
\\\\
Another drawback is the fact that Realm only supports one aggregate or collection type, \mono{RealmList}. 

Realm does not support types such as maps or enums, forcing us to either encode and decode these types with custom code, for instance by serialization, or by creating a class wrappers that can can contain the unsupported types.

\subsubsection{Encryption Keys}
\label{sub:encryption_keys}
A requirement when storing sensitive data encrypted is that the encryption key is not stored on the same unit as the data. We initially stored the encryption key in the source code of the application to simplify the encryption of the data. A problem with this approach and the reason why it is a requirement to store it separately is that a distributable application, known as an APK file, which is made publicly available, can be decompiled and the encryption key could potentially be extracted. 
\\\\
All that is needed for a potential attacker or malicious application is then to somehow get access to the internal storage of our application and fetch the Realm file, which the underlying Linux operating system tries to prevent for regular use. 
\\\\
It is in in most cases not possible to access files saved in an application private sub-file-system unless there is a security hole present, or that the user of the device has somehow rooted the device, i.e. is using a privileged account, and leaked access to it in which case it is possible to access the internal storage of every application on the device. An application or user with root privileges could then access our storage and with the use of the key found in the decompiled APK gain access to all the sensitive information that we store on the device.
\\\\
Instead of storing the encryption key on the device we decided to move it to the server, and actually also ensure that every device has its own encryption key. Having an encryption key for each device requires us to somehow be able to uniquely identify a device. 
\todo[inline]{Har vi skrevet om device id her?}
In having the device identifier it is possible for us to generate a 512 bit random encryption key the first time a device issues requests to our server and then simply return the newly generated key or a stored key if one has already been generated for the given device. This key exchange is of course done over an encrypted connection. We generate the key with the algorithm seen in \lstref{lst:encryption_php}. 

\lstinputlisting[
   style = PHP,
   caption = {The algorithm generating encryption keys.},
   label = {lst:encryption_php},
]{content/security/code_snippets/encryption.php}

This algorithm utilizes the random number generation features in the Linux kernel, by utilizing a special file, \mono{/dev/urandom} that interfaces the random number generation. Each time this file is read by the algorithm it will return a random byte, making it ideal to generate a sequence of random bytes representing an encryption key. The algorithm firstly create a file pointer to the \mono{/dev/urandom} file with the \mono{fopen} function. The function will return \mono{FALSE} if the file could not be opened, which is checked in \lineref{lst:fp_check}. Next, we will read the number of specified random bytes with the \mono{fread} function, which we will then return back to the call site as a binary string. The string is however not readable or easy to decode if it was send as is. Instead we convert it to a hex encoded string. \todo{Det giver ikke nogen mening at den skal være readable - Marhlder}
