\subsection{Client Requests}
\label{sub:client_requests}

The Android client needs to be able to access the routes mentioned in \secref{sub:server_interface}, in order to properly present campaigns on the device, and create/send snapshots correctly. There are a few different situations where such interaction between the client and server should take place. Some interactions are GUI related, and some are related to the retrieval of necessary information for the application to perform data gathering. Most of the aspects of communicating over HTTP, such as establishing a connection and encoding its messages, can be generalized. To simplify the process of generalizing HTTP requests, we chose to utilize a library, called Webb\footnote{https://github.com/hgoebl/DavidWebb}, for handling all the HTTP communication and encoding through a simple interface. 
\\\\
There are still some aspects that can be further improved upon, even though we use this library. This includes ensuring that the communication happens asynchronously, and thereby does not block the application's main thread; ensuring that the right headers and request types are sent; and lastly making some modifications to the TLS verification (see \secref{sec:transport_layer_security}). We generalized these aspects by inheriting from a class in the Android framework called \mono{AsyncTask}, which is an abstract class with an abstract method, named \mono{doInBackground}. This is the primary method of the \mono{AsyncTask}, and is the one method that is executed in a background thread. 
\\\\
Besides the abstract method, the class also contains different empty overridable methods that will be called during the task's life cycle, such as \mono{onPostExecute}, which as the name indicates will be called after the execution of the background task. This method will be run on the main thread of the application, which, for example, allows it to modify GUI elements. We found that, in generalizing the communication with the server, we needed to ensure that the HTTP response codes matched what we expected in the different situations. This included handling of what to do if the status was OK (status code 200), and also specifying what to do if the response code was not what we expected. We also figured that we often would need to specify what should happen if no connection to the server is available, such that no response code is returned. Therefore we overrode the \mono{onPostExecute} method as seen in \lstref{lst:on_post_execute}.

In the snippet we firstly check if the response parameter is null, in which case something went wrong in establishing the connection to the server, and the abstract method \mono{onConnectionFailure} will be called. Otherwise we check if the response code matches what we expect, and if it is we call the abstract method \mono{onResponse\-Code\-Matching} and if it does not we call \mono{onResponseCodeNotMatching}. These methods must be overridden when inheriting from this class. The expected response code is set through the constructor of the class, along with the URL the request should be sent to, and which HTTP request method should be used. The response that the \mono{onPostExecute} method receives as an argument, is the result of the doInBackground process, which can be seen in \lstref{lst:do_in_background}.

In the \mono{doInBackground} method we firstly create an \mono{SSLContext} in \linesref{lst:switch_method_start}{lst:switch_method_end}, which is related to the Transport Layer Security that we utilize and which is described in \secref{sec:transport_layer_security}. This is followed by setting some of the properties that we want to apply to every request, such as adding a header describing that the request should return JSON data and not a HTML response as normally used in browsers. 
\\\\
This is followed by checking which HTTP request type the request should be sent with in \linesref{lst:switch_method_start}{lst:switch_method_end}. We then utilize the Webb library to create a request of the given type, and pass it as an argument to the abstract method, \mono{sendRequest}. E.g. if the wanted request method is \mono{POST}, the \mono{sendRequest} method will be called with \mono{webb.post(url)} as seen in \lineref{lst:webb_post}. The \mono{sendRequest} method must, as with the previously mentioned abstract methods, be overridden.
