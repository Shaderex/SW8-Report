\chapter{Architecture}
\label{cha:architecture}

This chapter introduces the architecture that will facilitate a solution corresponding to the vision in \secref{sec:vision}. An overview of the architecture is shown in \figref{fig:system_architecture}, where it can be seen that we have two main components, a server and a client. A description of the components, their overall purpose, the communication between them, and their subcomponents is covered in this chapter. More detailed descriptions of the features they provide are covered in the following chapters: \charef{cha:security}, \charef{cha:gathering_sensor_data}, and \charef{cha:user_interfaces}.
