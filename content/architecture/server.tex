\label{sec:server}
The server, as seen in the top right part of \ref{fig:system_architecture}, both provides an Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the customers, and an Application Programming Interface (API) for the communication between the device and the server, such as upstream of snapshots from the devices of the participants or fetching campaign informations for the GUI on the device. 
\\\\
The server utilizes a web server technology, called NGINX, to serve dynamic content over the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Furhtermore the server hosts a PostgreSQL database, which allows us to store the data collected from all the participants, as well as information regarding customers and campaigns.  
With these features the server is now able to facilitate the Laravel\footnote{https://laravel.com} web framework, which is a framework built on the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern. This allows us to route incoming requests and differentitate between requests from a device wanting JSON and requests from a customer using a browser.
