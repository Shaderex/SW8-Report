% mobile devices er blevet mere udbredt blandt folk --> giver mulighed for at indsamle data
% Svært at komme et sted hen (i DK) uden at der er mobile devices i nærheden
% Nævn fluff om at det er en område under udvikling
% ``ubiquitous''

The area of ubiquitous computing is rapidly changing, and especially smart mobile technologies have in recent years had a major growth in the number of users and variation of devices. Our definition of ubiquitous devices includes, but is not limited to, smart phones, smartwatches, and smartbands. We use the word ubiquitous because there exist so many different kinds of smart devices and they are becoming increasingly more available and common over time. The sales of smartphones have increased by a factor of 11 since 2007 \parencite{statsia_smartphones}. Other mobile technologies, like wearables, have also seen an increase sales in the last couple of years. FitBit, a company selling smart wristbands, have seen a exponential increase in sales of their devices in the past five years \parencite{statsia_fitbit}.

There are many emerging technologies related to ubiquitous computing that are difficult to ignore, due to their potential to change the way we think about mobile devices and mobile technology in general. An example of this is the Google Contact Lens \parencite{google_contact_lens}, which is able to measure the blood sugar level of the wearer and transmit it wirelessly. The lens is supposed to improve the quality of life for diabetics, as they no longer have to use needles. Another new technology that has emerged is the ``big.LITTLE'' ARM CPU architecture \parencite{big_little_architecture}, which is a multi-core processor architecture that allows for better adjustments to dynamic computing needs by using less power whenever possible. It combines the best of powerful and battery draining ARM CPU cores with the best of slow, power efficient ones to achieve overall better performance and less power consumption. This architecture allows for battery draining high performance on demand and very power efficient background processing when a device is sleeping and not used actively. This is supposed to be a huge battery-improvement for mobile devices, which implies the introduction of a colossal amount of other technologies that benefit from increased battery lifetime and increased background processing capability.

New mobile sensor technologies are being introduced frequently, which could indicate increased access to additional wearable sensors. Some of these new sensors cannot be implemented in the smartphones of today, because some information can only be measured using sensors located close to the body. Examples of this could be the Google Contact Lens' ability to measure blood sugar, or heart rate monitoring from smart bands or smart earplugs. The sensors available from the same type of smart device vary and even a given sensor which is considered common in, for instance, smartwatches is not guaranteed to be present in all new devices. Some manufactures have value editions of their devices, where a low price is preferred over many sensors. For instance Motorola sells both Moto E (a value edition) and Nexus 6 (a flagship model) where the price and specification varies \parencite{moto_e_compared_to_nexus_6}
