\section{Utilizing Wearables for Interaction}
\label{sec:utilizing_wearables_for_interaction}

In our solution we only notify participants about pending questionnaires on their mobile phones, which is a suboptimal solution when users have other smart wearables available. Many new smart wearables offer new methods of interaction, such as voice interaction, gesture recognition, etc, which, in contrast to the hassle of having to extract a phone from the pocket, could provide new interesting ways of answering questionnaires. It is for example easy to imagine a scenario where a participant is at a situation where it would be frowned upon to pick up your phone and start interacting with it, but where it would be completely fine to look at your watch and tap it a couple of times to answer a questionnaire quickly. 
\\\\
In order to facilitate a scenario such as this, our application would have to be extended in a way that allows it to push notifications to the smart wearable and opening some activity where the user can answer the questionnaire. Furthermore the wearable would have have to have support for displaying questionnaires, or in some other way telling the participant what he/she has to answer, e.g. reading the questionnaire out loud. Additionally the wearable must make it possible to interact with it using some type of touch or gesture. If the wearable has support for these things, there are some considerations regarding our app having to be notified about the questionnaire answers, by whichever app handles the communication with the wearable.
