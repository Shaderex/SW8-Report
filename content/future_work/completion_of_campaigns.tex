\section{Completion of Campaigns}
\label{sec:completion_of_campaigns}

In general the user interface for participants could be improved in terms of keeping up the motivation for contributions of snapshots. This could be done by letting the participants know how far in the campaign they are by progress bars or other indicators telling them that they are almost done. As the system is now, the participants have no notion of knowing their progress in a campaign. For starters, one could imagine that there should be some indication for the participants of whether a campaign is  ``completed'' or not. One could imagine that by giving the users feedback and indications that they are done contributing might motivate them to join other campaigns. Besides this one could imagine that by being more thankful in form of thanking the user for answering questionnaires and so one might make the participants feel more appreciated and in the long run keep them engaged in the contribution of snapshots.
