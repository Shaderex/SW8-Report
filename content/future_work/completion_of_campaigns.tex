\section{Completion of Campaigns}
\label{sec:completion_of_campaigns}

In general the user interface for participants could be improved in terms of keeping up the motivation for contributions of snapshots. This could be done by letting the participants know how far in the campaign they are, for instance by displaying a progress bars. Currently, participants have no notion of knowing their progress in a campaign. One could imagine, that there should be some indication for the participants of whether a campaign is  ``completed'' or not, and that by giving the participants feedback and indications that they are done contributing, might motivate them to join other campaigns. Since customers might want to provide participants with prizes at the completion of a campaign, this would probably be a good motivation to continue contributing. Besides this, one could imagine that by being more thankful about the participants answering questionnaires, it would be easier to make participants feel more appreciated and in the long run keep them engaged in the contribution of snapshots.
