\section{Pagination of Campaigns}
\label{sec:pagination_of_campaigns}

In the campaign browser, described in \secref{sub:browsing_campaigns}, we currently download all the campaigns that are present in the database. Even though we ensure that we only download the minimum amount of information needed to display the list of available campaigns, we still download the entire list from the server. This could potentially consume a high amount of the memory on a participant's device, which is not desirable. It will not crash the view, because we use the \mono{Adapter} class from Android with a \emph{view holder} pattern, but it might still slow down the device.

The main issue is that, even if the participant only wants to see the first 20 campaigns, he could potentially be forced to download thousands, depending on the number of campaigns in the system. This could be solved by having some type of pagination (see \secref{sub:viewing_campaign_details}), where we only download a smaller amount of campaigns and then upon a request from the participant, present him with the next few elements in the collection. This would reduce the use of Internet bandwidth and thereby battery consumption of the participant's device, as well as prevent unnecessary consumption of memory.
