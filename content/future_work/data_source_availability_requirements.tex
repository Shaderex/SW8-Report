\section{Data Source Availability Requirements}

We have thought about allowing customers specify different levels of requirements for sensor and data source availability. It might be acceptable for some data sets to have missing values for some of the sensors while requiring that readings from other sensors must be present. This could for instance mean that some campaigns might require the presence of a certain sensor, say a heart rate sensor, while having for instance the WiFi data source optional and only included if available, i.e. turned on by the participant. The different levels of requirements for sensor availability could both be in regards to the actual capability of devices involved by the participant, i.e. that the involved devices must support the desired readings, and in regards to the availability of the reading, i.e. in cases where the devices include the data source or sensor but it is for some reason temporarily unavailable.

The sensors that customers add, when they specify a campaign, are not guaranteed to be in the snapshots the participants provide. This means, that if a customer specifies that he wants data from the accelerometer and barometer, he have no guarantee to get measurements from these sensors. The only guarantee we provide, is that the customer will get the snapshots if these sensors are available on the device of the participant. An improvement to the system would be to let the customer specify sensors to be either required or desired, meaning that he can be guaranteed that all the snapshots will contain for instance barometer data. However, if this was to be implemented, the potential base of participants would decrease, because some participants do not have all sensors. If our system allowed this type of restrictive specification, we would furthermore have to consider how to handle wearable devices and their sensors. This is due to wearable sensors not always being within reach of the device running the application, which would cause some issues on the client side and mess up the dataset for the customer.
