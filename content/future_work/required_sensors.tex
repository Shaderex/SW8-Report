\section{Required Sensors}

When customers specifies a campaign the sensors that the add to it are not guaranteed to be in snapshots from the participants. This means that if a customer specifies he wants data from accelerometer and barometer, he have no guarantee to get measurements from these sensors. The only thing that is for sure is that he will get the measurements if it is available on the device of the participant. One could imagine that the customer should be able to specify sensors to be either required or desired, meaning that he can be guaranteed that all the snapshots will contain for instance barometer data. However, if this is implemented the potential base of participants will decrease since not all participants have all sensors. Besides this, with a system allowing this type of specification would have to consider how to handle wearable device and their sensors. Since the wearable sensors are not always within reach of the device running the application, some special notion of availability would have be considered with respect to these type of sensors.
