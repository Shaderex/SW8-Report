\section{Required Sensors}

When customers specify a campaign, the sensors that they add to it are not guaranteed to be in the snapshots the participants provide. This means, that if a customer specifies that he wants data from the accelerometer and barometer, he have no guarantee to get measurements from these sensors. The only guarantee we provide, is that the customer will get the snapshots if they available on the device of the participant. An improvement to the system would be to let the customer specify sensors to be either required or desired, meaning that he can be guaranteed that all the snapshots will contain for instance barometer data. However, if this was to be implemented, the potential base of participants would decrease, because some participants do not have all sensors. If our system allowed this type of restrictive specification, we would furthermore have to consider how to handle wearable devices and their sensors. This is due to wearable sensors not always being within reach of the device running the application, which would cause some issues on the client side and mess up the dataset for the customer.
