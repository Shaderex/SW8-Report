\section{Configuration and Compatibility Testing}
\label{sec:extension_of_continuous_integration_server}

At the moment we only have a single Android device connected to the continuous integration server, which gives a rather limited insight in how well the application performs on different hardware and software configurations. A way to improve upon this would be to expand our configuration and compatibility testing setup with additional devices, if we had access to them. This could help ensuring that our application works on various combinations of hardware and software, which is a nice property to have.

An alternative to using some extensive local configuration testing setup, we could use the Google Cloud Test Lab\footnote{https://developers.google.com/cloud-test-lab/}, which allows the testing of one's application on popular brands and models of Android devices through a cloud service. Unfortunately, this is not a free service, but costs \$5 per hour per device used.
