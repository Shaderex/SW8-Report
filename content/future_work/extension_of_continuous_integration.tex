\section{Extension of Continuous Integration Server}
\label{sec:extension_of_continuous_integration_server}

At the moment we only have a single Android device connected to the continuous integration server, which gives a rather limited insight in how well the app performs on different hardware and software configurations. A way to improve upon this would be to expand the setup with additional devices, if we had access to them. This could help ensuring that our app works on various combinations of hardware, which is a nice property to have.

An alternative to using some extensive local configuration testing setup, we could use the Google Cloud Test Lab\footnote{https://developers.google.com/cloud-test-lab/}, which allows the testing of one's app on popular brands and models of Android devices through a cloud service. Sadly, this is rather expensive (\$5 per hour per device used), so this would only be possible once we had some kind of budget for the application.
