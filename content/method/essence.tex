\label{sec:essence}

In this project we will try to employ some of our development time on using the Essence methodology that is currently being created by lecturer at Aalborg University Ivan Aaen. Essence is a methodology that helps agile software development teams create innovative and sustainable solutions. The methodology focuses on the process after getting a basic idea of what the desired product is, in order to decide which direction the development should proceed in. Generally speaking, it focuses on translating ideas into solutions, and coming to a clarifying understanding of which challenges the team can encounter and how they can he resolved.
