\chapter{Method}
\label{cha:method}

This chapter describes the development method that was used to guide this project. We chose to use Extreme Programming (XP) \parencite{xp}, with a few changes, which is described in this chapter. The main reason why we considered XP, was because we wanted a more concrete approach, with engineering practices, and test-driven method compared to other agile methods such as Scrum, which we have had experience with on previous semesters. Besides using XP we have chosen to also utilize the Essence methodology as well, which is a methodology that aims to support innovative projects, and focuses on enabling developers and other stakeholders to see a problem from multiple perspectives.
