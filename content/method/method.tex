\chapter{Method}
\label{cha:method}

This chapter describes the development method that was used to guide this project. We chose to use Extreme Programming (XP) \parencite{xp}, with a few changes, which is described in this chapter. The main reason why we considered XP, was because we wanted a more concrete approach, with engineering practices, and test-driven method compared to other agile methods such as Scrum, which we have had experience with on previous semesters.
