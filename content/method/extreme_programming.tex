\section{Extreme Programming}
\label{sec:extreme_programming}

In this project we have chosen to use some of the aspects from the Extreme Programming (XP) methodology, which is a type of agile software development method, that has a high amount of focus on customer satisfaction, developer productivity/welfare and high product quality. The methodology focuses on delivering partial products to the customers as they need them, instead of just a complete product far in the future. In XP this is normally achieved by use of several core practices, such as: on-site customer, test first development, pair programming, planning poker, continuous integration and delivery and daily meetings. XP emphasizes the value of simplicity, communication, feedback, respect, courage. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Simplicity is about taking the simplest path to delivering a minimum viable product without compromising quality. 
	\item Communication between every member of the team, including the on site customers, is essential to deliver a product that everybody is proud of. 
	\item Feedback should be taken seriously, and demonstrations should be done early in the process and frequently.
	\item Respect between the team members, the customers, and management is important.
	\item Courage allows the team to take on new challenges without the fear of failing, because nobody works alone. The developers should have the courage to tell the truth about progress and estimates. 
\end{itemize}

The following sections will describe some of the basic concepts from the XP methodology that we have chosen to use, how we have implemented them, and some of the conflicts there are between our project and the methodology.

\subsection{Iterations}
\label{sub:iterations}
Extreme Programming encourages rather short iterations in comparison to other agile development methods. The iterations are of constant length and should be between one to three weeks in length. Because of their constant length they can be used to track the progression and the velocity of a project by evaluating the amount of work done in the end of an iteration compared to the estimates given to the tasks in the given iteration. 
\\\\
In our project we have chosen to use iterations of two weeks (calendar time) in length. Each of these will end with a review of what we have managed to accomplish in the given iteration. One of the issues with using calendar time to schedule our iterations is the fact that we are students, meaning that we have to follow the courses on the semester as well. This makes the amount of time we have available vary between the different iterations, making it more difficult to estimate how much we can handle in each iteration. To try to alleviate this issue we calculate the amount of time we have in a given iteration and take that into consideration when planning it. 

\subsection{Releases}
XP encourages frequent and small releases to the customers. Each iteration ends with a deliverable in XP and these deliverables can be evaluated by the customer, that then can decide if it should be taken into production. The idea behind frequent releases is that the earlier the functionality is used by the customers, the sooner any potential bugs can be found and fixed by the developers. Furthermore, it allows the customers and the team to evaluate if the project is on the right track.
\\\\
We have chosen to make a release every second XP iteration, meaning that we will make a release every four weeks. For each of the releases we will make a major product release, but we will also build a minor product release for iterations that does not end in an XP release if the product is accepted at the given time. All release are pushed to our \href{https://github.com/Shaderex/SW8-Android/releases}{GitHub Page}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Shaderex/SW8-Android/releases}} and can also be found on the CD in \todo{Add reference to CD appendix}. The deliverables for each iteration we have completed are described in \todo{Ref til appendix med Deliverables}. 

\subsection{Taskboard and User Stories}
\label{sub:taskboard_and_user_stories}
In XP a release plan is created for each release, during a release planning meeting. 
\todo[inline]{Add photo of taskboard}
The user story cards are made in collaboration during release planning while trying to role-play on-site customer. 

The customer role-playing is backed by our vision as seen in \todo{Ref til Essence Vision afsnit}. 

All user stories are accompanied with an acceptance test which is designed together with the user story. 

A potential issue with Extreme Programming is that an on-site customer is required. However, this project is a student project with no paying customer or user. 

This means that we must role-play the on-site customer during the development. This might be challenging because it can be difficult to enter the mindset of a customer. For this reason during the iteration review and planning meetings we assign each team member roles, which they must role-play. This means that one team member is assigned to role-play the customer during the entire review/planning meeting. Other roles include tester, developer, and user. 

This role-playing makes it easier for us, as a team, to prioritize user story cards because one team member only have to consider one mindset during these meetings.

Lastly XP also have techniques to handle uncertainty in a semi structured way, by the use of spikes, which is used to explore areas with little to no knowledge. 

\subsection{Daily Standup Meeting}
\label{sub:daily_standup_meeting}
Knowledge sharing is encouraged in XP by using different practices such as daily stand up meetings and pair programming. For us, knowledge sharing is important, since all members of the group should have insight in the product and the written report. 

\subsection{Test Driven Development}
\label{sub:test_driven_development}
Extreme Programming seemed attractive to us due to the fact that the method is test-driven. We have been lacking structured test and evaluation during the development of the previous semester projects, where tests and evaluation were done in an ad-hoc fashion. In an agile development method, we feel that a test-driven, or a test-first approach would help us solve this problem and achieve a more structured approach to enforce testing.

\subsection{Documentation}
Another potential issue with XP could be that it does not have any built in practices or techniques to produce a technical student report during development. XP does not encourage documentation. Documentation is only considered in XP if it gives the customer value. We had to adapt our development method to include the production of a technical student report. Another potential pitfall was for us, when using XP, the lack of quality assurance (QA) team assigned to the project. A QA team assists the development team to spot potential issues with acceptance test. Because of the fact we have not been working solely with XP in previous semester projects we cannot evaluate the quality of acceptance test based on prior experience.
