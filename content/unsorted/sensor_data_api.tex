\section{Sensor Data API}
\label{sec:sensor_data_api}

This section describes how data from the different mobile sensor are made available to the programmer through an Application programming interface without actually touching upon how this looks in code. 

The sensors in modern wearable consumer electronics have different characteristics and have different access patterns. Some can synchronously be accessed, on demand, and others report continues stream of values. A few of them can only be directly queried asynchronously i.e. it might require arbitrary long time in order to get a fixed reading with the desired precision. Luckily these sensors of asynchronous can be cached which in Android is for instance the case of the GPS sensor.
