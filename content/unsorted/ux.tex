\section{Participant Experience Evaluation}
\label{sec:participant_experience_evaluation}

We want uMiner to be as general as possible in terms of who participants might be. Meaning that we want to target as many different personas as possible in terms of user experience of the Android application. We have for this reason tried to create some sort of user experience evaluations in regards to the part of the system the participants are going to use. The idea of this evaluation is to determine if there are some obvious flaws in the design of how our Android application in regards to disturbing the participants. We want to investigate if we developed a solid start for part of the client application that notifies and asks the participants questions.

\subsection{Test Setup}
\label{sub:test_setup}

We have created a test campaign called ``Alcohol and you'' which should emulate the type of campaign a final customer might specify. The campaign specification can be seen in TABREF. This specification means that we take 600 measurements every hour and we desire answers for a questionnaire every other hour.
