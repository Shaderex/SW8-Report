\section{Sensor Data Availability}
\label{sec:sensor_data_availability}
\todo[inline]{Annotate each sensor with what type it is, eg. accelerometer is a constant measurement, compass is using 2 sensors etc.}

This section describes how data from the different mobile sensor are made available to the programmer through an Application programming interface without actually touching upon how this looks in code. 

The sensors in modern wearable consumer electronics have different characteristics and have different access patterns. Some can synchronously be accessed, on demand, and others report continues stream of values. A few of them can only be directly queried asynchronously i.e. it might require arbitrary long time in order to get a fixed reading with the desired precision. Luckily these sensors of asynchronous can be cached which in Android is for instance the case of the GPS sensor.

\subsection{Accelerometer}
\label{sub:accelerometer}
Measures how the devices accelerates in three dimensions. Often used together with gyroscope. Gives a continuous stream of readings from the sensor.

\subsection{Gyroscope}
\label{sub:gyroscope}
Measures the orientation of the device referenced to the gravity pull of the device. Often used together with accelerometer. Gives a continuous stream of readings from the sensor.

\subsection{Proximity Sensor}
\label{sub:proximity_sensor}
Measures (estimates) how close the device is to the nearest object, using an infrared beam. This estimation has higher accuracy in lower distances. Values are only reported as they change and the proximity sensors of some devices returns binary values that represent ``near'' or ``far'' instead of an actual distance.

\subsection{Compass}
\label{sub:compass}
Measures (estimates) the orientation of the device relative to the earths magnetic field. The phone really uses a magnetometer and the accelerometer together in to get the effect of a compass. The orientation is given as a continuous stream of values.

\subsection{Barometer}
\label{sub:barometer}
Measures (approximates) the air pressure, in hPa (a.k.a. mbar), around the phone. The results of the measurements are given as a continuous stream of readings from the sensor. 

\subsection{WiFi}
\label{sub:wifi}

The WiFi radio in mobile devices can be used for more than just pure data communication with the local network and the Internet. Different information about access points and the signal to these access points can for instance be used to approximate indoor location.  
Potential values from WiFi could be: reachable access point names, their communication standards, and signal strength.

\subsection{Global Positioning System (GPS)}
\label{sub:gps}
Approximates the latitude and longitude of the device based on satellite triangulation. Most modern mobile devices uses A-GPS, meaning that the GPS is assisted by the cellular network. The rough positioning is based on the cellular network and the accurate position is triangulated using GPS satellites. An on demand reading can only be given asynchronously as the device would first have to contact multiple cell towers and GPS satellites and over time reach a sufficiently accurate position which can take some time. Luckily the latest position is cached, at least for Android, which allows for quick access to a few minutes old location. \todo[inline]{Skriv noget om hvordan GPS fungerer p√• andre devices}  

\subsection{Cellular Networking}
\label{sub:cellular_networking}

Cellar networking can, similarly to WiFi be used for more than pure communication as data from different mobile towers and the signal strength to these towers can be useful besides communication. Potentially interesting values could be: Mobile country code, mobile network code, mobile cell identity (mast identity), cell tower technology type, signal strength.

\subsection{Optical Heart Rate Sensor}
\label{sub:optical_heart_rate_sensor}
Measures the heart rate, using a light source and a camera to estimate your heart rate.

\subsection{Ultraviolet (UV) Sensor}
\label{sub:uv_sensor}
Measures the UV radiation hitting the device.

\subsection{Skin Temperature Sensor}
\label{sub:skin_temperature_sensor}
Measures the temperature of skin touching the device.

\subsection{Ambient Light Sensor}
\label{sub:ambient_light_sensor}
The ambient light sensor makes it possible to measures the lightning in the surroundings of the device from one of its sides in lux. The sensor only reports new values when changes in lux occurs.

\subsection{Capacitive Sensor}
\label{sub:capacitive_sensor}
Measures touch of the device against the wearer of the device.

\subsection{Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) Sensor}
\label{sub:galvanic_skin_respons_}
Measures the conductivity of the surface against the device.
