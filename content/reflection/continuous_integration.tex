\section{Continuous Integration}
A place where we used a lot of time early on in the project was on our continuous integration server. We do not believe that we have gained as much as we have spent on issues with the server and the setup of our mobile device used for running the instrumented tests on the server.  Even though it did discover errors during the development period, we used a lot of time getting the instrumental tests to work on the server, and fix errors that occurred only because of hardware failures on the server or the equipment attached to it. One could consider that having a continuous integration server for a project only spanning over four months might be too time consuming to integrate, however, we have gained knowledge about the setup for such a server. Additionally, the continuous integration server discovered some errors in the project earlier than we would have noticed them ourselves, which allowed us to address them faster than we would otherwise have been able to.
