\section{Background Service Design}
\label{sec:background_service_design}

Our design of always having our background service running, which does not imply that it actually takes up CPU resources, allows us to continuously capture a participants context and upload data at opportune times and not be interrupted. But the design still has a weakness, in that the process is kept in memory even tho there is no campaign running and no snapshots to be uploaded. There is no real reason for this other than simplifying the design. The problem with keeping the process in memory, even though its not actively doing anything, is that it still consumes memory and thereby drains the battery a little. Hogging memory in the Android system also has the side effect that it increases the probability of Android freeing other activities or services which might have to be recreated in a near future and thus consume battery to do so \parencite{android_memory_management}.
